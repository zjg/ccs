- use TU's from headers as PCH inputs to other TU parsing
   - not sure if this is needed, my machine is fast enough :)
- ability to define 'projects'
   - is this needed? maybe for listing all references of a symbol, refactoring, etc...
- ability to define proper include directories
   - system dirs
   - project dependencies
   - just use build commands
      - clang command DB
      - some random file next to each source file
- unsaved files
   - temporary files
- Optional chunks (can't do recursive structs in thrift...)
- limit number of candidates returned
   - returning 4000+ candidates causes significant delay on my VM...
   - should pre-sort the list somehow (priority?), then limit it
